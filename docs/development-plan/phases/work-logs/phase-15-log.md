### 2026-10-18 — phase planned
- **Tasks:** none started; 15.1 to 15.14 are planned
- **Branch:** `docs/15-harness-fixes-phase` — the plan only
- **Decisions / deviations from the plan:**
  - The owner decided to run step 2 of the harness-framework plan as a development phase instead of a standalone procedure,
    developed before Phase 10.
  - The tasks follow the triage of the 2026-10-17 harness review (its follow-up table, merged in #213) and the order of groups in
    `docs/harness-framework/README.md` §2.2, whose step 2 now points to this phase.
  - A task that changes the meaning of a product rule or an `AGENTS.md` rule asks the owner before merging, even inside the phase.
- **Problems / blockers / findings:** none.
- **Next step:** start 15.1 (the profile) when the owner asks ("Start Phase 15").
- **Verify with:** `npm run docs:check`

### 2026-10-18 — serial execution order
- **Tasks:** none started; the execution order changed
- **Branch:** `docs/15-serial-order` — the plan only
- **Decisions / deviations from the plan:** the owner decided to run Phase 15 as one serial line instead of parallel agents.
  The tasks share `AGENTS.md`, the hooks, the design files and the docs check, and depend on conventions set by earlier tasks
  (the role names of 15.1, the rule locations of 15.2, the status-marker model of 15.8). The order puts 15.8 before 15.5 and 15.4,
  and 15.10 (which renumbers §12.5) last before the re-review.
- **Problems / blockers / findings:** none.
- **Next step:** start 15.1 when the owner asks ("Start Phase 15"). Ask the owner the two questions of 15.6 before that task:
  a seeded `random()` in the script API, and a password parameter of `connect` for another player's bot.
- **Verify with:** `npm run docs:check`
